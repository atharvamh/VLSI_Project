# VLSI design of a combined CLA and Barrel Shifter controlled through a MUX array
This project was a part of a VLSI course offered at NITK
Involves a VLSI designing of CLA adder cum subtractor and Barrel Shifter controlled through a mux array
The layout was done using MAGIC, pharosc.tech technology files were used
IRSIM was used for simulation purposes to check logic results, power dissipation, capacitance,etc.
